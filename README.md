Gonaldinho tackles the modified version of classic `Ping Pong` study case for concurrency programming in Go. It was made with an expectation to gain a firmer grasp of understanding on goroutine, channels, and mutexes. The modification includes the following:
- There's a chance of player missed the ball
- Multiple players
- Scoring Mechanism
- Player roles
